# freecodecamp_survey-form

This is an adaptation of a short project with the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design track. It is a survey form that would gather information on how the FreeCodeCamp platform could be improved. As this was one of my first projects in Web development, while lacking the skills of color coordination, I used a color scheme that was similar to the site's. This was the initial submission, however, I intend on "cleaning" up the code, and adding functionality to it as I learn more.
